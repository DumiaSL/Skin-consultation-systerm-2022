# Skin-consultation-systerm-2022
The project involves developing a software system for a skin consultation centre. It includes implementing several classes and methods to hold and manage information about doctors, patients, consultations, and bookings while adhering to the encapsulation principle.

The project is divided into three phases. In the first phase, classes such as Person, Doctor, Patient, and Consultation are implemented, along with their respective methods. Additionally, a class called WestminsterSkinConsultationManager is designed to manage the system and implements the SkinConsultationManager interface.

In the second phase, a console menu is implemented, allowing users to add or delete doctors, print the list of doctors, and save information to a file.

Finally, in the third phase, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed, allowing users to view the list of doctors, book consultations, add patient information and notes, and visualize all stored information while also including encryption of data for data privacy.

Marks are allocated for each phase of the project, and additional classes can be implemented to make the code more robust or user-friendly.
